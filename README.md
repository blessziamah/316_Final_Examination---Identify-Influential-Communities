# Community-Driven Influencer Optimization for Viral Marketing

Welcome to the **Community-Driven Influencer Optimization for Viral Marketing** GitHub repository! This project aims to revolutionize the landscape of viral marketing by harnessing the collective power of influential communities within social networks. By moving beyond individual influencers, we explore how community dynamics can reshape marketing strategies, amplify engagement, and drive content dissemination.

## Project Overview

In the rapidly evolving realm of digital marketing, the traditional influencer model is undergoing a paradigm shift. This project addresses the challenge of capturing and retaining the attention of digitally empowered consumers by focusing on communities as drivers of content propagation. By identifying influential nodes within these communities and tailoring engagement strategies to their preferences, we seek to enhance campaign effectiveness and engagement rates.

## Features

- **Community Detection Algorithms:** Leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms such as Girvan-Newman and Louvain, we detect and analyze influential communities within social networks.
- **Novel Centrality Metrics:** We introduce composite centrality metrics that encompass degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality to provide a comprehensive view of influence potential.
- **Ethical Engagement:** Our approach prioritizes user consent, privacy, and transparent communication, ensuring responsible influencer collaboration.
